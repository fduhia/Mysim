COM68K / ASM68K / EMU68K Source Code

November 30, 2002 

This software is distributed with the intent that students and/or instructors
be able to make their own corrections or modifications as they see fit. The
code for ASM68K and EMU68K was written long ago when I was not yet an
experienced C programmer. I did lots of things the hard way. You will also
notice my lack of comments. COM68K is a newer application, but also has
minimal comments. Even so, I hope someone out there finds this code useful.
If you do modify the code, I would appreciate a copy via email at

antonakos_j@sunybroome.edu.

And remember: James L. Antonakos and Prentice Hall are not responsible for 
anything that is done with existing or modified versions of this software
release.

The Source Code

For ASM68K, you need: ASM68K.C and ASM.H

For EMU68K, you need: EMU68K.C and 68DEFS.H

For COM68K, you need: COM68K.C

All files compile using Borland C++ V3.1. Modifications to the memory
allocation code (and possibly other pieces) will be required when porting to
a different compiler.
